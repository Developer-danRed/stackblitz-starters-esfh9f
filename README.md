# Dynamic Usernames Form in Angular

This project demonstrates how to build a **dynamic form** for managing **usernames** using Angular's **Reactive Forms**. The form is dynamic because users can **add** or **remove** username fields at runtime. Each username can also have other properties like which can be dynamically modified.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Reactive Forms
Angular's **Reactive Forms** offer a programmatic approach to form management. The forms are defined in the component class, which makes them easier to manage and test, especially for complex dynamic forms.

### 2. FormArray
A **FormArray** is a special type of **FormControl** that holds an array of form controls, such as `FormGroup` or `FormControl`. It allows you to create dynamic forms where controls can be added or removed at runtime.

### 3. FormGroup
A **FormGroup** is a collection of **FormControl** or **FormGroup** instances. In this case, each **username** is represented by a `FormGroup` containing individual `FormControl` instances for properties like **username**, **email**, and **phone**.
